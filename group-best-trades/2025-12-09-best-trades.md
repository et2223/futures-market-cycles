12:26 – Reversal  
12:36 – Trend Line  
14:40 – REM  

## Count by Setup

- Continuation: 1  
- REM: 2  
- Reversal: 1  
- Trend Line: 1  
- 15m Re-Entry: 0  
- EMT: 0  

## Cycle Notes

- No EMT and no 15m Re-Entry trades made the “best of day” list.  
- Continuation, REM, Reversal, and Trend Line all appeared, with REM showing up twice.  
- This points to a **hybrid / trap-tilted trend day**: the market allowed continuation, but traps and failed moves (REM, Reversal) were a big part of the structure, especially around midday.  
- Trend Line showing once adds to the idea of a controlled, structured environment rather than pure chop.
