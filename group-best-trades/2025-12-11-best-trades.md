## Cycle Notes

- Early **REM at 9:40** confirms a classic trap at/near the open after a FED move and mid-range overnight positioning.  
- **EMT at 9:52**, followed by **Continuation at 9:55**, shows a fast transition from trap into a real trend leg once the first fake move washed out.  
- Additional EMTs at **10:29** and **11:49**, plus multiple Continuation trades, confirm a **trend-biased session** once structure was established.  
- The **15m Re-Entry (stack)** at 10:16 indicates a failed attempt to break, then reclaim, an important level, fitting the Hybrid / trap behavior of this phase.  
- Multiple **REM trades** (9:40, 13:17, 15:55) show that traps and failed pushes remained part of the day’s character, especially early and late.  
- Overall structure: **Trap at the open → Trend-dominant middle → Trap / Hybrid behavior later in the day.**
