## Cycle Notes

- Early session produced a **15m Re-Entry**, confirming a failed initial breakout / trap behavior typical of FOMC days.  
- After that, **EMT appeared twice**, followed by **Continuation** and **Trend Line** trades, signaling a clear shift into a **trend / trend-biased cycle** once the trap phase resolved.  
- The presence of both **stacked Continuation** and a **Trend Line** trade supports the idea of a strong, structured trend into the afternoon.  
- A late **REM** at 15:37 reflects the usual post-FOMC trap / failed move pattern into the close.  
- Overall: **Trap → Trend → Late-day Trap** structure, with EMT + Continuation dominating the trend phase.
