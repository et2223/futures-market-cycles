# ONE-PAGE TRADING SUMMARY

==================================================
SETUPS
==================================================

EMT – Breakout continuation from 15-minute range  
Trend Continuation – Non–15-minute level break + pullback  
15m Re-Entry – False break of 15-minute range → re-entry reversal  
REM – Failed reversal → trend resumes (double cross / trap resolution)  
Reversal – End-of-trend or range extreme reversal with structure  
Trendline Touch – T3 entry along clean trendline

==================================================
MARKET CYCLES → VALID SETUPS (PRIORITY)
==================================================

### 1. Trend Cycle (Clean Trend Day)
- Primary:  
  - EMT  
  - Trend Continuation  
  - Trendline Touch  
- Secondary:  
  - REM (only if a counter-move fails)  
- Avoid / low priority:  
  - 15m Re-Entry  
  - Naked Reversal

Signature:
- Midband strongly sloped  
- HH/HL or LL/LH staircase  
- First breakout holds and continues  
- Little or no deep re-entry to 15m range

---

### 2. Hybrid Trend Cycle (Trend + Traps)  ← **Very common**
- Primary:  
  - Trend Continuation  
  - Trendline Touch  
  - REM  ← **High priority here**  
- Secondary:  
  - EMT (only when the open is very clean)  
- Situational:  
  - Reversal at clear extremes  
- Lower probability:  
  - 15m Re-Entry (only if a major level break fully fails)

Signature:
- Trend structure present, but with clear trap phases (failed reversals, REMs).  
- Continuation works, but rarely in a straight line.  
- REM is often the best risk–reward in the middle of the trend.

---

### 3. Rotational / Trap Cycle
- Primary:  
  - 15m Re-Entry  
  - REM  
  - Reversal  
- Secondary:  
  - Trendline Touch (inside the range)  
- Avoid / low priority:  
  - EMT  
  - Aggressive Continuation

Signature:
- Flat or choppy midband  
- First breakout fails and returns inside the 15m range  
- Price repeatedly rejects PDH/PDL or range extremes  
- Many failed attempts in both directions

---

### 4. Momentum / Breakout Cycle
- Primary:  
  - EMT  
- Secondary:  
  - Trend Continuation  
- Situational:  
  - Trendline Touch (with shallow pullbacks)  
- Avoid / low priority:  
  - 15m Re-Entry (unless the breakout truly fails)  
  - Reversal (until clear exhaustion)

Signature:
- Strong gap or overnight drive  
- First breakout is clean and holds  
- Shallow pullbacks to midband / 80 SMA  
- Price often rides Keltner bands

---

### 5. Trap / REM Cycle
- Primary:  
  - REM  
- Secondary:  
  - 15m Re-Entry  
  - Reversal  
- Situational:  
  - Trend Continuation after REM  
- Avoid / low priority:  
  - EMT on first move (too likely to be the trap)

Signature:
- Clear failed reversals  
- Multiple double-crosses  
- Market repeatedly fakes direction before committing

---

### 6. End-of-Trend Cycle
- Primary:  
  - Reversal  
  - REM (when the final attempt to resume trend fails)  
- Secondary:  
  - 15m Re-Entry (if the last breakout fails back into range)  
- Avoid / low priority:  
  - EMT  
  - Fresh Continuation trades late in the move

Signature:
- Climax moves into key HTF levels  
- Big wicks, failed drives, divergence of structure  
- Trendline breaks with strong rejection

==================================================
DAILY EXECUTION FLOW
==================================================

Pre-market:
- Fill cycle-check template  
- Make an initial cycle hypothesis (Trend / Hybrid / Rotational / Momentum / Trap / End-of-Trend)  
- Choose ONE primary setup family for the open  
- List setups to avoid

10:00 AM Recheck:
- Re-run the 10:00 AM Cycle Checklist:
  - Acceptance vs rejection at PDH/PDL/15m range  
  - Midband slope (sloped vs flat)  
  - Clean vs violent pullbacks  
  - Staircase vs choppy structure  
  - First breakout success vs failure  
- Adjust the cycle label if live action contradicts pre-market expectations.  
- If cycle shifts to Hybrid Trend → keep REM active as a primary setup.

During session:
- Trade only setups valid for the current, confirmed cycle.  
- If the character clearly changes (e.g. trend breaks and rotation starts), shift to the appropriate cycle setups.

End of day:
- Fill evening review.  
- Update trade log.  
- Update cycle notes if regime is shifting (e.g. from rotational to trend, from trend to trap).
