# DAILY REVIEW – 2025-12-08 (EXAMPLE)

## 1. Actual Market Cycle (Hindsight)

Actual cycle today: Hybrid → Momentum/Breakout later  

Evidence:
- Early mixed action around PDH with some rotation.  
- Clear breakout and strong directional move in mid-morning.

## 2. Setup Performance

Setups that worked well today:
- EMT – Clean breakout after 15-minute range with midband/80 SMA separation and new highs.  
- Trend Continuation – Worked well after EMT when pullbacks to midband were clean.

Setups that failed or underperformed:
- None taken outside plan.

## 3. Plan Adherence

- Primary setup traded as intended?  
  - Yes – EMT used as main setup.  

- Avoided setups marked “avoid”?  
  - Yes – No naked reversals or early 15m Re-entries.  

- Risk limits respected?  
  - Yes – No overtrading; within max trades and loss limits.

## 4. Key Lessons

- Waiting for full EMT criteria (price + midband break + new high) produced high-quality trades.  
- Avoiding early noise before 10:00 was beneficial.

## 5. Adjustments for Tomorrow

- Expected cycle for tomorrow: Possible continuation of momentum if no major reversal structure forms.  
- Setups to prioritize: EMT, Trend Continuation; REM at exhaustion points.  
- Setups to avoid: Reversals unless very clear at extremes.  
- Specific behavior to watch at the open:
  - Whether price accepts above PDH or rejects back into prior day’s range.
