# 15-Minute Re-Entry Trade (False Break Reversal)

## Structure

Break of the 15-minute range fails; price and midband re-enter the range; reversal follows.

## Conditions

- Price re-enters fully inside the 15-minute opening range.  
- Keltner midband also re-enters the range.  
- Midband/80 SMA cross confirms reversal.  
- Trendline (if present) is broken in favor of the new direction.

## Entry

- First pullback to the midband once both price and midband are fully back inside the 15-minute range.

## Stop

- Beyond the false-break swing (the extreme of the failed breakout).

## Invalidation

- Midband remains outside the range.  
- Pullback is not the first pullback after re-entry.  
- Trendline remains unbroken when a structural break is required.

## Notes

- High win-rate reversal setup in rotational or trap-heavy conditions.  
- Works especially well around PDH/PDL and other key extremes.
