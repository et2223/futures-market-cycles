# EMT – Easy Money Trade (Breakout Continuation)

## Structure

Breakout of the 15-minute opening range followed by the first corrective pullback into the Keltner midband or the 80 SMA on the 610-tick chart.

## Conditions

- 15-minute opening range completes at 9:45.  
- Price breaks the 15-minute high or low.  
- Keltner midband also breaks the same level.  
- Trend confirmed by separation of the midband and the 80 SMA (momentum alignment).  
- Price makes a new high or low beyond the breakout level.

## Entry

- First pullback to the Keltner midband or 80 SMA after both price and midband have broken the 15-minute range level.  
- Entry occurs as price resumes in the breakout direction.

## Stop

- Beyond the corrective swing or beyond the midband.

## Invalidation

- Midband fails to cross the breakout level.  
- Price fails to establish a new high/low after the breakout.  
- Pullback is not the first pullback post-breakout.

## Notes

- High-clarity continuation setup in momentum or hybrid cycles.  
- Often aligns with strong opening drives and clean expansion legs.
