# Trendline Touch Trade

## Structure

Trending pattern (HH/HL or LL/LH) with a trendline drawn from points 1 and 2; price then returns to the trendline for point 3.

## Conditions

- Clean, symmetrical trend structure (series of HH/HL or LL/LH).  
- Well-defined trendline between the first two structural points.  
- At entry, the trendline lies behind both the midband and the 80 SMA.  
- Confluence with a key level, SMA, or Keltner outer band is preferred.

## Entry

- Entry on the third touch of the trendline (T3).

## Stop

- Just beyond the trendline touch.

## Invalidation

- Trendline intersects the indicators at the entry location.  
- Trend structure unclear or asymmetrical.  
- Trendline appears forced or improperly anchored.

## Notes

- Works best in clean trend cycles with moderate, orderly pullbacks.  
- Symmetry and confluence significantly improve probability.
