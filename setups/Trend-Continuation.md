# Trend Continuation Trade

## Structure

Break of a major non–15-minute level followed by a corrective pullback and continuation that produces a new high or low.

## Conditions

- Price and midband break the same key level.  
- New highs/lows confirm trend continuation.  
- Midband and 80 SMA aligned directionally.  
- Clean trend environment (non-overlapping, non-range-bound structure).

## Entry

- First pullback to the midband after the break of the key level.

## Stop

- Beyond the corrective pullback swing.

## Invalidation

- Failure to produce a new high/low after the break.  
- Midband fails to break the level with price.  
- Double-top or double-bottom structure forms at or near the level.

## Notes

- General continuation pattern not restricted to the 15-minute opening range.  
- Performs best on established trend days and in momentum cycles.
