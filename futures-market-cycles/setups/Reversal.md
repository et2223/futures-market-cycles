# Reversal Trade

## Structure

Range extreme or end-of-trend pattern followed by a clear rejection, break of the trendline, and indicator confirmation of reversal.

## Conditions

- Clear rejection structure at a key level:
  - Double top  
  - Double bottom  
  - Head-and-shoulders or similar pattern  
- Break of the trendline of the prior move.  
- Midband and 80 SMA cross in favor of the new direction.  
- Clean structural context at a logical extreme or major level.

## Entry

- First pullback to the midband after the trendline break and indicator confirmation.

## Stop

- Beyond the rejection swing (extreme high/low of the pattern).

## Invalidation

- Trendline remains intact.  
- No valid rejection pattern.  
- Indicator cross occurs without proper price-action structure.

## Notes

- Best used in exhaustion and end-of-trend conditions.  
- If the reversal is not visually obvious, the setup is considered lower quality.
