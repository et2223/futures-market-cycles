# REM Trade – Failed Reversal → Trend Resumption

## Structure

Established trend → reversal attempt → reversal failure → trend resumption with a double indicator cross.

## Conditions

- Clear pre-existing trend (series of HH/HL or LL/LH).  
- Reversal attempt fails to establish a sustained move in the opposite direction.  
- Indicator cross #1 occurs during the failed reversal.  
- Indicator cross #2 occurs when the prevailing trend resumes.

## Entry

- First pullback to the midband after the second indicator cross.

## Stop

- Beyond the corrective pullback swing or beyond the midband.

## Invalidation

- Double-cross sequence does not occur.  
- Reversal attempt successfully establishes a new trend.  
- Pullback occurs before the second cross.

## Notes

- High-probability continuation setup in trap-heavy or hybrid environments.  
- Helps avoid getting trapped in failed reversal attempts.
