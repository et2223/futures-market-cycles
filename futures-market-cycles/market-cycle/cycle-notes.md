# Market Cycle Notes

Use this file for longer-term notes on how ES is behaving across weeks and months.

Example:

## 2025-12

- Early December:
  - Increased presence of EMT and Trend Continuation in group best trades.
  - 15m Re-Entry and REM appear mainly around traps near the 15-minute range.
- Implications:
  - Focus on EMT as primary in momentum/hybrid regimes.
  - Use REM and 15m Re-Entry around failed breaks and traps.
  - De-prioritize naked reversals and isolated trendline trades during choppy or trap-heavy opens.
